    "#### Tavily Search Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Tavily is dedicated to creating an advanced search layer that bridges large language models (LLMs) with the web, empowering AI agents with real-time, context-aware data. With its adaptable search functionalities, Tavily allows AI systems to refine search approaches, gather raw content for in-depth analysis, or obtain concise summaries for rapid understanding. Unlike traditional models limited by fixed training datasets, Tavily’s Search and Extract features integrate semantic, contextual, and keyword-based search methods to provide up-to-date, actionable insights, enhancing data-driven decision-making processes.\n",

    "#### Openrouter\n",
    "\n",
    "The system uses OpenRouter to interact with a language model for various tasks such as query generation, relevance assessment, and context extraction. This allows for dynamic and intelligent information gathering based on the evolving understanding of the user's query."
