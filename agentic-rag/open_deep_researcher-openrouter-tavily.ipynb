    "#### Tavily Search Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Tavily is dedicated to creating an advanced search layer that bridges large language models (LLMs) with the web, empowering AI agents with real-time, context-aware data. With its adaptable search functionalities, Tavily allows AI systems to refine search approaches, gather raw content for in-depth analysis, or obtain concise summaries for rapid understanding. Unlike traditional models limited by fixed training datasets, Tavily’s Search and Extract features integrate semantic, contextual, and keyword-based search methods to provide up-to-date, actionable insights, enhancing data-driven decision-making processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Openrouter\n",
    "\n",
    "The system uses OpenRouter to interact with a language model for various tasks such as query generation, relevance assessment, and context extraction. This allows for dynamic and intelligent information gathering based on the evolving understanding of the user's query."

      "Comprehensive Report: Manufacturing Exemption for Pipes, Pumps, and Compressors in Texas\n",
      "\n",
      "Executive Summary:\n",
      "The status of pipes, pumps, and compressors for manufacturing exemption in Texas is nuanced and depends on specific circumstances of use within the manufacturing process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Detailed Analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Exemption Qualification Criteria\n",
      "- Manufacturing equipment may qualify for sales tax exemption if:\n",
      "  * Used directly in the manufacturing process\n",
      "  * Results in a product being produced for sale\n",
      "  * Causes a physical or chemical change in a product\n",
      "  * Involves nonremovable components of the manufacturing process\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Equipment-Specific Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "A. Pipes\n",
      "- Generally do NOT qualify for unconditional manufacturing exemption\n",
      "- May be exempt if part of the direct manufacturing process\n",
      "- Intraplant transportation pipes typically excluded from exemption\n",
      "\n",
      "B. Pumps\n",
      "- Potentially qualify for exemption when:\n",
      "  * Directly supporting manufacturing equipment\n",
      "  * Powering or controlling qualifying manufacturing processes\n",
      "  * Integral to creating a product for sale\n",
      "\n",
      "C. Compressors\n",
      "- Similar qualification criteria to pumps\n",
      "- Exempt when directly involved in manufacturing value creation\n",
      "- Must be non-removable and essential to the manufacturing process\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Exemption Application Process\n",
      "- Manufacturers must complete Form 01-339 (Texas Sales and Use Tax Exemption Certificate)\n",
      "- Submit certificate to vendor\n",
      "- Provide clear documentation of equipment's role in manufacturing\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Key Limitations\n",
      "- Transportation-related equipment generally excluded\n",
      "- Supporting equipment must demonstrate direct manufacturing contribution\n",
      "- Temporary or removable equipment less likely to qualify\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "Pipes, pumps, and compressors may qualify for manufacturing exemption in Texas, but qualification depends on specific use, direct manufacturing contribution, and ability to demonstrate essential process involvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendation:\n",
      "Consult Texas Comptroller's office or a tax professional for definitive determination of exemption status for specific equipment configurations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disclaimer:\n",
      "This report is based on available contextual information and should not be considered definitive legal tax advice.\n"
