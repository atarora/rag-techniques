# rag-techniques
A git repo showcasing RAG Techniques for building Naive to Advance RAG solutions
The Repo has various examples of :

1. Advance Rag - Contains example of [Adaptive Rag](advance-rag/adaptive_retrieval.ipynb) and [Self Query RAG](advance-rag/self_query_rag_qdrant_langchain.ipynb) examples 
2. Agentic Rag - Contains example of [Deep Research](agentic-rag/open_deep_researcher-openrouter-tavily.ipynb) Rag using Tavily and Openrouter.
3. Multimodal Rag - Contains example of [Multimodal Rag](multimodal-rag/colpali_state_of_ai.ipynb) based on Colpali on State of AI Report
4. Naive Rag - I believe I have tonnes of example in my [other repo](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-rag-eval) for this one


Keep building ! Feedback welcome !
